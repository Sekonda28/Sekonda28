## About Me

My name is Matt and I am a web and mobile full-stack javascript developer,
having switched careers from traditional project management in 2021. In addition
to six months where I self-taught basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, I recently
completed a web development bootcamp with Le Reacteur in Paris focusing on the
MERN stack. I am currently seeking an internship or junior position to solidify
and expand my skills and to learn from more experienced developers.

<li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>

In addition I have experience using the Forest Admin data management tool,
Stripe payments integration and Cloudinary for image and video storage.

## What I am working on now

My current priorities are focussing on Typescript and Next.js as well as further
developing my skills with React. I also have an interest in Web 3.0 and wil be
looking into building an app using React and Solidity.
